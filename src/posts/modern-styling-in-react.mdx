In a remarkable breakthrough, researchers have successfully created a 3D-printed human heart that replicates the realistic anatomy and functionality of a real human heart. The breakthrough was achieved by a team of scientists at Tel Aviv University in Israel. The team used advanced imaging technology and 3D printing to create the heart, which is considered a major step forward in the field of cardiac research and regenerative medicine.

## How it is made up of 

The 3D-printed heart is made up of `human tissue` and `blood vessels`, and it mimics the structure and function of a real human heart. The team used a patient's own cells to create the heart, which means that it could be transplanted into the patient without the risk of rejection. This is a significant development, as it has been a major challenge in the field of `organ transplantation`.

## Processors

**To create the 3D-printed heart, the team first took a biopsy of fatty tissue from a patient.** 
1. The fatty tissue was then processed to create a personalized hydrogel, which was used as the "ink" for the 3D printer. 
2. The printer then created a heart model by layering the hydrogel with cells that were taken from the same patient. 
3. The cells were grown in a lab and differentiated into heart cells, which were then integrated into the heart model.

### Early Stage Development

The 3D-printed heart is still in the early stages of development, and there is a long way to go before it can be used in transplantation.
 However, the breakthrough is significant because it shows that 
 it is possible to create functional human organs using 3D printing technology.
  This could potentially revolutionize the field of regenerative medicine, 
  as it would provide a new source of organs for transplantation.

### Research Team

The research team is now working on improving the functionality of the 3D-printed heart. They are also exploring the use of the technology to create other organs, such as `kidneys and livers`. If successful, this could help to address the shortage of organs for transplantation and save countless lives.

### Overall

Overall, the creation of a 3D-printed human heart with `realistic anatomy and functionality` is a major breakthrough in the field of regenerative medicine. While there is still much work to be done before the technology can be used in transplantation, the breakthrough represents a significant step forward in addressing the shortage of organs available for patients in need.

### Not yet manufactured

The heart model created by the researchers is not yet functional enough to be transplanted into a patient. However, the technology represents a major step forward in the field of regenerative medicine, as it demonstrates the potential for creating functional human organs using 3D printing technology.

One of the major challenges in the field of `organ transplantation` is the risk of rejection by the recipient's immune system. By using the patient's own cells to create the `heart`, the researchers have addressed this issue, as the `risk of rejection` is significantly reduced.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the creation of a 3D-printed human heart with `realistic anatomy` and `functionality` is a significant breakthrough in the field of `cardiac` research and regenerative medicine. The technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of organ transplantation and provide a new source of organs for patients in need. While there is still a long way to go before the technology can be used in transplantation, the breakthrough is a major step forward in the field of `regenerative medicine`.
